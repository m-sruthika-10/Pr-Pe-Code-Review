PR Review Instructions
Copilot Code Review Instructions
Java Files

If docs/java_coding_standards.md exists, apply its coding standards to all files with the .java extension and Java-dependent files (e.g., pom.xml, build.gradle) for compliance with standards such as naming conventions, documentation, and formatting.
Ignore non-Java files (e.g., .py, .js, .md) for Java standards unless explicitly referenced in docs/java_coding_standards.md.

Python Files

If guardrails.txt exists, apply its coding standards to all files with the .py extension and Python-dependent files (e.g., requirements.txt, pyproject.toml) for compliance with standards such as naming conventions, formatting, and dependency specifications.
Ignore non-Python files (e.g., .java, .js, .md) for Python standards unless explicitly referenced in guardrails.txt.

Mixed Pull Requests

For pull requests containing both .java and .py files:
Review .java and Java-dependent files (e.g., pom.xml, build.gradle) against docs/java_coding_standards.md if it exists.
Review .py and Python-dependent files (e.g., requirements.txt, pyproject.toml) against guardrails.txt if it exists.


Ensure no overlap in standards application (e.g., do not apply Java standards to .py files or Python standards to .java files).

General Instructions

Only review files matching the specified extensions and their dependent files based on the available standards files (docs/java_coding_standards.md for Java, guardrails.txt for Python).
If only one standards file exists (e.g., docs/java_coding_standards.md but no guardrails.txt), review only the corresponding file types (e.g., .java and Java-dependent files).
Provide detailed comments for violations, referencing the specific standard from the relevant standards file.
Skip files that do not match the specified extensions or dependency criteria (e.g., .js, .md, .html).

Jira Feature Check

For each PR, Jira ticket details are stored in the .github directory in files named jira-ticket-details-<TICKET_ID>.txt (e.g., .github/jira-ticket-details-APB-6.txt).
Review the PR changes and verify they implement the functionality described in the corresponding jira-ticket-details-<TICKET_ID>.txt file.
Ensure the PR does not include unrelated changes beyond the scope of the Jira ticketâ€™s summary and description.
Provide comments for any discrepancies between the PR changes and the Jira ticket details, referencing specific details from the ticket file.
